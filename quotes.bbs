It's about finding something interesting

You believe everything you see on the internet?
Sigh. That's all these anti-vaxxers and conspiracies theorists are about.
They're trying to convince themselves that they're "smarter"
than everyone else and have increased agency in their lives -
solely based on their access to "secret" knowledge.
They don't really stop and think that if information
is on the internet, it's not exactly secret.

so the greatest Liar has his Believers;
and it often happens, that if a Lie be believ'd only for an Hour,
it has done its Work, and there is no farther occasion for it.
Falsehood flies, and the Truth comes limping after it;
so that when Men come to be undeceiv'd, it is too late;
the Jest is over, and the Tale has had its Effect.
  - Jonathan Swift, 1710

The road to learning by precept is long,
by example short and effective.

Four score and seven years ago
our fathers brought forth
on this continent,
a new nation,
conceived in Liberty, and dedicated
to the proposition
that all men are created equal.
Now we are engaged in a great civil war,
testing whether that nation,
or any nation
so conceived and so dedicated,
can long endure.
We are met on a great battle-field of that war.
We have come to dedicate
a portion of that field,
as a final resting place
for those who here gave their lives
that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting
and proper that we should do this.
But, in a larger sense,
we can not dedicate --
we can not consecrate --
we can not hallow -- this ground.
The brave men, living and dead,
who struggled here,
have consecrated it,
far above our poor power
to add or detract.
The world will little note,
nor long remember
what we say here,
but it can never forget
what they did here.
It is for us the living, rather,
to be dedicated here
to the unfinished work
which they who fought here
have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us
to be here dedicated
to the great task remaining before us --
that from these honored dead
we take increased devotion
to that cause for which they gave
the last full measure of devotion --
that we here highly resolve that
these dead shall not have died in vain --
that this nation, under God,
shall have a new birth of freedom --
and that government
of the people,
by the people,
for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.

Habit will sustain you whether you're inspired or not.
Habit will help you finish and polish your stories.
Inspiration won't. Habit is persistence in practice.

If you have an important point to make,
don't try to be subtle or clever.
Use a pile driver. Hit the point once.

To pit this single insight, that in the Absolute everything is the same,

to palm off its Absolute as the night in which,

this is cognition naively reduced to vacuity.

That's not the way the world really works anymore.
We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality.
And while you're studying that reality--judiciously, as you will--
we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too,
and that's how things will sort out. We're history's actors...and you,
all of you, will be left to just study what we do.

During the years we worked on Viaweb
I read a lot of job descriptions.
A new competitor seemed to emerge
out of the woodwork every month or so.
The first thing I would do, after checking
to see if they had a live online demo,
was look at their job listings.
After a couple years of this I could tell
which companies to worry about and which not to.
The more of an IT flavor the job descriptions had,
the less dangerous the company was. The safest kind
were the ones that wanted Oracle experience.
You never had to worry about those.
You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers.
If they wanted Perl or Python programmers,
that would be a bit frightening -
that's starting to sound like a company where the
technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.
If I had ever seen a job posting looking for Lisp hackers,
I would have been really worried.

the flat tire" that so characterizes computing today.

We know about as much about software quality problems
as they knew about the Black Plague in the 1600s.

is only one disease. We just suffer -- and keep pouring our
sewage into our water supply.

You are much better off with no numbers than meaningless ones.
The minute you believe numbers uncritically, that is,
without understanding how they're calculated and
how well they measure whatever they're supposed to measure,
you will generate a breed of employee
who will produce numbers and not results.
Your data-processing system will then serve not to describe reality
but to lie about it.

yet we have this consolation with us, that the harder the conflict,
the more glorious the triumph.

To sum up: it is wrong always, everywhere, and for anyone,
to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.
  - William Kingdon Clifford, "The Ethics of Belief"

Belief, that sacred faculty which prompts
the decisions of our will,
and knits into harmonious working
all the compacted energies of our being,
is ours not for ourselves but for humanity.
It is rightly used on truths which have been
established by long experience and waiting toil,
and which have stood in the fierce light
of free and fearless questioning.
Then it helps to bind men together, and
to strengthen and direct their common action.
It is desecrated when given to
unproved and unquestioned statements,
for the solace and private pleasure of the believer;
to add a tinsel splendour to
the plain straight road of our life
and display a bright mirage beyond it;
or even to drown the common sorrows
of our kind by a sefl-deception
which allows them not only
to cast down but also to degrade us.
  - William Kingdon Clifford, "The Ethics of Belief"

The "heavenly actors" populating the spiritual universe of [C.S.] Lewis
were, like many religious myths, intellectually lazy creations of
fundamentally ignorant minds.  It is a far grander kind of imagination
that is needed to fathom the real universe.

"Rot" equivalents: what is said versus
    (what is meant)
I will bear that in mind
    (I am going to ignore that altogether)
What was the thinking behind that?
    (Were you on drugs when you came up with such a harebrained idea?)
up to a point
    (not at all)
I hear what you say
    (I disagree)
I'm going to miss working with so many talented people
    (I can't wait to get out of here)
I'll get back to you on that
    (I want to forget about that altogether)
I'm going to say a few words
    (I am going to say a great many)
Don't worry, I'm not going to give a speech

sufficiently well to teach it is usually unwilling to do so.
  - H. L. Mencken

The trouble with fighting for human freedom
is that one spends most of one's time defending scoundrels.
For it is against scoundrels that oppressive laws are first aimed,
and oppression must be stopped at the beginning

In the days of rudimentary chemistry, the mind was thought to be
a beaker of swirling volatile essences. Then came classical
physical mechanics, and the mind was regarded as a clocklike thing,
with springs and wheels. Then it was steam-driven, maybe.
A combustion chamber.
Then came electricity and Freud, and it was a dynamo of polarized energies -
the id charged one way, the superego the other.
Now, in the heyday of the microchip, the brain is a computer. A CPU.
  - Walter Kirn, "The Autumn of the Multitaskers"

Multitasking messes with the brain in several ways.
At the most basic level, the mental balancing acts that it requires -
the constant switching and pivoting - energize regions of the brain
that specialize in visual processing and physical coordination and
simultaneously appear to shortchange some of the higher areas
related to memory and learning. We concentrate on the act of
concentration at the expense of whatever it is that we're
supposed to be concentrating on.
  - Walter Kirn, "The Autumn of the Multitaskers"

If we were to experience the world exactly as it is,

Up the airy mountain

For fear of little men;
  - William Allingham [1824-1889]

I must down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky,
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,
And the wheel's kick, and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking,
And a gray mist on the sea's face, and a grey dawn breaking.
  - John Masefield [1878-1967]

I must down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call which may not be denied.
And all I ask is a windy day with white clouds flying,
And flung spray and blown spume, and the seagulls crying.
  - John Masefield [1878-1967]

I must down to the seas again, to the vagrant gypsy life,
To the gull's way, and the whale's way, where the wind's like
   a whetted knife.
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow rover,
And a quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.
  - John Masefield [1878-1967]

We are the music-makers,
And we are the dreamers of dreams,
Wandering by lone sea-breakers,
And sitting by desolate streams.
World-losers and world-forsakers,
Upon whom the pale moon gleams;
Yet we are the movers and shakers,
Of the world forever, it seems.
  - Arthur O'Shaughnessy [1844-1881]

A knife does not cut

  - Persian saying

A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,
take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a
tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly.
Specialization is for insects.

In some cases, all it requires is that you rationally point out

Brooks's Law:
   Adding manpower to a late software project
   makes it later.

Part of the reason so many companies continue to develop software
using variations of waterfall is the misconception that the
analysis phase of waterfall completes the design and the rest of the
process is just non-creative execution of programming skills.

Writing code has a place in the human hierarchy

I fear the the new object-oriented systems may suffer

An apprentice carpenter may want only a hammer and saw,
but a master craftsman employs many precision tools.
Computer programming likewise requires sophisticated tools
to cope with the complexity of real applications, and only
practice with these tools will build skill in their use.
  - Robert L. Kruse, Data Structures and Program Design

I am a design chauvinist. I believe that good design is magical
and not to be lightly tinkered with. The difference between
a great design and a lousy one is in the meshing of the thousand details
that either fit or don't, and the spirit of the passionate intellect
that has tied them together, or tried. That's why programming --
or buying software -- on the basis of "lists of features" is a doomed
and misguided effort. The features can be thrown together, as in a
garbage can, or carefully laid together and interwoven in elegant
unification, as in APL, or the Forth language, or the game of chess.
  - Ted Nelson

Executives with the tiniest smattering of knowledge
assume that anyone can write a program, and only now
are programmers beginning to win their battle for recognition
as true professionals.  Not just anyone, with any background,
or any training, can do a fine job of programming.
Programmers know this....

The national shortage of adult minds

Live a good life. If there are gods and they are just,
then they will not care how devout you have been, but
will welcome you based on the virtues you have lived by.
If there are gods, but unjust, then you should not want

but will have lived a noble life that will live on in the
memories of your loved ones.
  - Marcus Aurelius

Reason takes you to one place,

...comedy is deemed inferior to tragedy primarily because
of the social prevalence of narcisisstic pathology.  In other
words, people who are too self-important to laugh at their
own frequently ridiculous behavior have a vested interest

Like that fusty old patriarch of the Bible,

To pit this single assertion, that 'in the Absolute all is one,'
against the organized whole of determinate and complete knowledge,
or of knowledge which at least aims at and demands complete development -
to give out its Absolute as the night in which, as we say,
all cows are black -
that is the very naïveté of emptiness of knowledge.
  - Hegel, "The Phenomenology of Spirit"

When the will to power trumps all other considerations --
competence, effectiveness, even lawfulness -- it should be
no surprise to find public officials clinging to their jobs

Power, after all, was not the means to an end,
it was the end.
   - François Furstenberg, letter to NY Times, 5/12/07

Of course there are Christian fascists in America.
How else to describe, say, the administrator of a faith-based
drug treatment program who bound and beat a resident, then
subjected her to 32 straight hours of recorded sermons?
Or American Veterans in Domestic Defense, the uniform-clad
cadres who took former Chief Justice Roy Moore's Ten Commandments
monument on tour after a judge banned it from the Montgomery, Ala.,
judicial building? (American Jews, the group's founder explained,
are "a driving force behind trying to take everything to do with
Christianity out of our system.") Whatever one's definition of this
most vexed of "f" words, in a time when the chief of staff for United
States Senator Tom Coburn tells a reporter soon after the Terri Schiavo
crisis, "I don't want to impeach judges; I want to impale them," to
flinch from examining the authoritarian impulses coursing through
American life becomes a moral abdication.

Manhattan has generated a shameless architecture
that has been loved in direct proportion to its
defiant lack of self-hatred, has been respected
exactly to the degree that it went too far.
  - Rem Koolhaas (b. 1944)

Manhattanism is the one urbanistic ideology that has fed,
from its conception, on the splendors and miseries of the
metropolitan condition -- hyper-density -- without once losing faith
in it as the basis for a desirable modern culture. Manhattan's
architecture is a paradigm for the exploitation of congestion.

To me the sole hope of human salvation lies in teaching Man
to regard himself as an experiment in the realization of God,
to regard his hands as God's hand, his brain as God's brain,
his purpose as God's purpose.
He must regard God as a helpless Longing,
which longed him into existence
by its desperate need for an executive organ.

... your spiritual teachers caution you against enquiry - tell you
not to read certain books; not to listen to certain people;

Never, never, never believe any war will be smooth and easy,

The world always makes the assumption that the exposure of an error

error, and maybe one worse than the first one.

Benedicto:
May your trails be crooked, winding, lonesome, dangerous,
leading to the most amazing view.
May your mountains rise into and above the clouds.
May your rivers flow without end, meandering through
pastoral valleys tinkling with bells, past temples and castles and
poets' towers into a dark primeval forest where tigers belch and
monkeys howl, through miasmal and mysterious swamps and down into a
desert of red rock, blue mesas, domes and pinnacles and grottos of
endless stone, and down again into a deep vast ancient unknown chasm
where bars of sunlight blaze on profiled cliffs, where deer walk
across the white sand beaches, where storms come and go as lightning
clangs upon the high crags, where something strange and more beautiful
and more full of wonder than your deepest dreams waits for you ---
beyond that next turning of the canyon walls."

This other Eden, demi-paradise,
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war,
This happy breed of men, this little world,
This precious stone set in the silver sea,
Which serves it in the office of a wall,
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands,
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

Well you see, Norm, it's like this...
A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo.
And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones
at the back that are killed first.  This natural selection is good
for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the
whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.
In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the
slowest brain cells.
Now, as we know, excessive intake of alcohol kills brain cells.
But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.
In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells,
making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.
And that, Norm, is why you always feel smarter after a few beers.

has been found among the people of the highest civilization,
and in nations of the highest proficiency in the arts.
  - Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederate States of America

The Bible does not specifically condemn the practice of slavery.
It gives instructions on how slaves should be treated

but does not outlaw the practice altogether.

But I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened

Based on my work with violent men, I'd say it's [hazing] a form
of initiating men into the standard expected male gender role in

on them. People are willing to sacrifice their bodies in order to

We need to continue to ask serious questions about where

I respect the people who invented these myths [of religion]

huge amount of information now - real concrete material.
We need to formulate new visions of our meaning and ourselves.

The alleged scientists behind intelligent design...
have never published a peer-reviewed paper because
that's a lot of work.  And, frankly, "science" is
actually marginal to the larger purpose of building
their rickety Trojan horse to smuggle God back into
the public schools.
  - Jack Hitt, Harper's Magazine, July 2003

This is what I like most about intelligent design --

three centuries of dickering, creationism has
whittled itself down to a bare nub, a single idea,
an assertion of epistemology -- that we cannot
"know" without God.

the use of money, but the rich are ignorant
of the nobility of science".

Mathematics is the supreme arbiter.
From its decisions there is no appeal.
We cannot change the rules of the game,
we cannot ascertain whether the game is fair.
We can only study the player at his game; not,
however, with the detached attitude of a bystander,
for we are watching our own minds at play.
  - David van Dantzig

This result is too beautiful to be false;
it is more important to have beauty in one's equations
than to have them fit experiment.
  - Paul Dirac

To divide a cube into two other cubes,
a fourth power or in general any power whatever
into two powers of the same denomination
above the second is impossible, and I have
assuredly found an admirable proof of this,
but the margin is too narrow to contain it.
  - Pierre Fermat

There are surely worse things than being wrong,

This, therefore, is mathematics:
she reminds you of the invisible form of the soul;
she gives light to her own discoveries;
she awakens the mind and purifies the intellect;
she brings light to our intrinsic ideas;
she abolishes oblivion and ignorance
which are ours by birth.
  - Proclus

And what are these fluxions?
The velocities of evanescent increments?
They are neither finite quantities,
nor quantities infinitely small,
nor yet nothing. May we not call them
ghosts of departed quantities?
  - George Berkeley

Neglect of mathematics works injury
to all knowledge, since he who is ignorant
of it cannot know the other sciences
or the things of the world.

  - Henri Poincaré

Thought is only a flash

Science is built up with facts,
as a house is with stones.
But a collection of facts
is no more a science
than a heap of stones is a house.

I met a man once who told me that
far from believing in the square root

This branch of mathematics [Probability]

When solving problems,

Men who are unhappy,
like men who sleep badly,
are always proud of the fact.

A habit of basing convictions upon evidence,
and of giving to them only that degree or certainty
which the evidence warrants, would, if it became general,
cure most of the ills from which the world suffers.
  - Bertrand Russell

At first it seems obvious,
but the more you think about it
the stranger the deductions
from this axiom seem to become;
in the end you cease to understand

Once upon a time, when I was training to be a mathematician,
a group of us bright young students taking number theory
discovered the names of the smaller prime numbers.
 2: The Odd Prime -- It's the only even prime, therefore is odd. QED.
 3: The True Prime -- Lewis Carroll: "If I tell you three times, it's true."
31: The Arbitrary Prime -- Determined by unanimous unvote. We needed an
arbitrary prime in case the prof asked for one, and so had an election.
91 received the most votes (well, it *looks* prime) and 3+4i the next
most. However, 31 was the only candidate to receive none at all.
Since the composite numbers are formed from primes, their qualities
are derived from those primes. So, for instance, the number 6 is
"odd but true", while the powers of 2 are all extremely odd numbers.

You should never bet against anything

Suppose you believe that today some of your funds

In attempting to find out just what, if anything,

determine when the good old days were.  In some

Exchange Commission, when there weren't no ten

It occurs to me that the man and his religion are one
and the same thing.  The unknown exists.  Each man
projects on the blankness the shape of his own particular

case is in essence explaining himself.  When a fanatic
is contradicted, he feels a threat to his own existence;
he reacts violently.
